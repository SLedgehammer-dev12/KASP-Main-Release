    """
    Calculate blow-by flowrate based on linear control valve characteristics.
    The blow-by flowrate is proportional to the ratio of the nominal (100% open) Cv
    to the calculated Cv at blow-by conditions for an assumed flowrate.

    Scope note: the linear scaling is exact only for linear-trim control
    valves. For equal-percentage (or other) trims the result is a screening
    estimate — confirm with the valve characteristic curve.

    assumed_flow_kg_h: Estimated flowrate at blow-by conditions (kg/h)
    nominal_cv: Selected nominal Cv of the control valve (e.g. at 100% opening)
    calculated_cv_at_blowby: Calculated Cv for the assumed flowrate

    Returns:
    blowby_flowrate in kg/h
